> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

- Reading and writing
- Attention to detail
- Spotting the differences

> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

- Reading and writing

    Reading is how you learn the commands and conventions of the language, and writing is the process of putting
    the reading into practice, at first following given examples to produce expected results, then experimenting with
    variations to get a broader understanding of how things work.


- Attention to detail

    When programming, you have to keep in mind that computers don't just do what they are told, they do *exactly* what
    they are told, nothing more or less.
    The more exactly you can define your expected result, the better you can write the code to meet that expectation.
    Conversely, when evaluating a programs behavior, you need to be able to tell when that behavior is *almost* what is expected,
    and be able to determine where the code is not quite correct.


- Spotting the differences

    In my mind, this is a refinement of 'attention to detail'. You _will_ make mistakes when coding, no matter how well you pay
    attention during design and implementation.  If code is not running, especially when using known good examples, what is
    the difference between your code and the example?
    Once the code is running, you need to be able to note minor differences between actual and expected results,
    i.e. a heading should be centered, but is it instead slightly off?


> Why do you need to not copy and paste?

Copy/paste defeats the whole purpose of the 'writing' skill mentioned above. It will allow you to see the results of
working examples, but will not allow the feedback loop of typing/making mistakes/correcting mistakes, which also allows practice
in the other two skills.


> Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Practice is important in order to get knowledge embedded in the mind, where it can later be retrieved quickly.  The first time
a concept is encountered, you'll be using examples and references to verify usage and expected behavior. After repeated
usage of the concept, the references will be needed less and less for common scenarios.  After basic concepts are second nature,
more difficult concepts can be tackled, which will likely require more repetition than the basics, thus requiring persistence
in completing the necessary practice.
